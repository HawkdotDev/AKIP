      text="In the OPEX model for solar energy, customers can enjoy solar power without any upfront investment. The solar company owns, operates, and maintains the solar system, while the customer pays for the energy consumed at a predetermined rate. This model ensures cost savings, risk-free adoption, and access to clean energy with no capital expenditure."
      sub="Open Access projects enable large consumers to procure solar energy directly from solar farms through the grid. This model provides cost-effective, sustainable energy while bypassing traditional distribution companies. Ideal for businesses with high energy demands, it ensures lower tariffs, reduced carbon footprint, and compliance with green energy mandates."
