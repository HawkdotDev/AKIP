The solar company owns, operates, and maintains the solar system, while the customer pays for the energy consumed at a predetermined rate. This model ensures cost savings, risk-free adoption, and access to clean energy with no capital expenditure."
      sub="Open Access projects enable large consumers to procure solar energy directly from solar farms through the grid. This model provides cost-effective, sustainable energy while bypassing traditional distribution companies. Ideal for businesses with high energy demands, it ensures lower tariffs, reduced carbon footprint, and compliance with green energy mandates."
